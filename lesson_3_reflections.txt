When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	At the moment you want to work on your program not only on your own computer but others or even online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because some features might not finished and an up-to-date syncing might cause chaos.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: other's github repository copying to my own github repository 
	clones: one's github repository copying to local repository
	branches: copying repository in local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	In this way it is able to always have a branch that the updated repository could trace to.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Dicuss changes with others online or face-to-face. In most cases it would be harder without using Git/Github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	At the moment you want to change something but are not sure about it, and you want to ask your partners opinion before commit into master branch;
	This way helps collaborators to work more effciently and more clearly.
