When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	At the moment you want to work on your program not only on your own computer but others or even online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because some features might not finished and an up-to-date syncing might cause chaos.
